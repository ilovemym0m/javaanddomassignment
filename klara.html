       <h2>The Story</h2>
      
    <p id="p1">My mind slowly went blank as I quickly tried to recall the thoughts in my head. Am I dead? Did they finally kill me? Did they kill Tyrone? These profound questions filled my head until finally, they came to silence. <br>
       The sidewalks were flooded with blood and other suspicious substances; I even accidentally stepped in one of the puddles, messing up my white sneakers. It was 2078 in Queens, New York and, I Klara Imani Johnson, lost everyone I knew and loved; my family, friends, and even my pets. I felt like I had no one, and was stuck in a dark vortex. While walking, I stumbled upon a gigantic border, emulating a base, and almost as soon as I knocked on what looked like the door, a dark-skinned guy with short braids who looked like he hadn't washed his face in weeks, had a gun in my face. Shocked, I begged for my life and he, fortunately, let me in. I continued to wonder what could happen from there.<br>
       Let in, I discovered that the guy's name was Tyrone, who was a sixteen-year-old who had lost everything, like myself. We bonded over those sorrowful facts and eventually became more than close friends in two years. Their opinions intrigued me, and their ways of life. We helped each other cook, practice fighting, and even do these healing circles where we talk about our emotions. I met the rest of the community living inside that border, and they felt closer to me than my actual family, life was immensely peaceful for a while, until suddenly in the blink of an eye, it wasn't. <br>
       The border was breached, because of a minor mistake, the volunteer guard had made. People were dying, and Tyrone and I had to evacuate the base. We were the only ones left, fighting other zombies. As I was running, I tripped and fell over some vines. As attempting to get up as fast as possible, I realize that I had sprained my ankle, as it hurt to walk without limping. Finally, I could not walk anymore and finally fell to my knees. In concern, Tyrone ran up to me, doing anything he could to help me;  but to spare his life, I begged him to go on without me. With tears in his eyes, he ran away from the zombies and as he turned around, watched as they ripped me into pieces, devouring almost every part of my body; everything started to become dark. <br>
       So is it over? Do I become one of them as well? I wondered this until suddenly, it seemed as if I had no more control over my body...</p>  
      
       <h2>Tyrone's POV</h2>

       function myFunction() {
       document.getElementById("demo").textContent = "I had watched someone I was overly obsessed with get eaten alive; how was I supposed to move on from this? I was stuck in a state of shock but had to snap out of it to survive, something that she would have wanted me to do. I ran for miles, running into zombies, not sleeping or eating, and not stopping until I landed somewhere safe. It took a month, but I finally made it. After finding the people I trusted, I was still trapped in a depressive state; barely eating, sleeping, or talking. I still even heard her voice slightly, saying that I, Tyrone Jaquavion Williams, still have a chance at leading a normal life. After a couple of months, I started to feel elated again and started to move on from Klara. With help from my new community, I felt better and started to become healthy again, psychically and mentally. Society seemed to become better as well, everything seeming meek besides one or two incidents weekly. I could also finally become grateful for living. One sunny morning, I woke up to absolute silence; no children screaming outside, no adults laughing, just silence. I got up, immediately hearing the moans and groans of a zombie. I quickly got up, went outside, and saw in my horror witnessed everybody I grew close with was surrounded by a pool of blood. As I turned around, a familiar-looking zombie approached me; it was Klara. She charged at me, causing me to attempt to run and hide from her. I ran towards my jeep, looking back every once in a while; I then felt liquid running down my back, realizing that she scratched me. I cried in pain feeling the burning sensation of my back being touched by the aggressive wind. I quickly rushed into the driver's seat as she hopped on the hood. I turned on the windshield washers in an attempt to wipe her away. Accidentally, I cut off her head in an attempt to gently wipe her away. Rapidly getting out of the car, I saw her beheaded body, realizing that I did that; I committed murder. Trapped in an additional depressive state, I realized that I was all alone again, but this time I was not going to run away once again. This time, I realized this had to end. I went into the house, grabbed a pistol, placed it to my head, looked at the sunlight once more, and then it all went black.";
